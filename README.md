TCPHound
======================

TCPHound is a free Win32 utility for auditing TCP connections. I decided to develop TCPHound because existing utilities out there are unable to meet my needs. TCPHound has 2 unique features.

1.   **TCPHound provides data logging.** Most utilities provide only real-time output. Once connections are closed, they are removed from the list. Hence, you would have to stare at the screen continuously. With TCPHound, I can start the utility and come back 2 hours later to scroll through the logs. 
2.   **TCPHound tracks connection duration.** Connection duration is an important indicator of the type of traffic. A short connection might indicate a malware phoning home. A long connection with high outbound traffic might indicate data theft. A long connection with bursty traffic might indicate a C&C channel. TCPHound can also resolve the organization which owns the IP, hence allowing you to quickly identify suspicious connections.

[TCPHound v1.2 64bit](https://limbenjamin.com/files/TCPHound/TCPHound_v1.2_x64.exe) - SHA1() = e92148bbe271ca3354d0f3fa68c2581ea45376f4  
[TCPHound v1.2 32bit](https://limbenjamin.com/files/TCPHound/TCPHound_v1.2_x86.exe) - SHA1() = 760b75c45a1b9eba30f1c990dd22e07fb37ec4f2  

Due to a limitation in the GetModuleBaseName WINAPI, running the 32bit version on a 64bit machine will result in wrong or missing process names. Hence, please use the 64bit version on a 64bit machine.


Q&A
===
  
  
Why not Wireshark?
------------------
Wireshark is a great tool if you know what you are looking for. Otherwise, you are looking for a needle in a haystack. TCPHound complements Wireshark by allowing you to identify suspicious connections. You can then filter your Wireshark captures and view traffic originating from only that specific IP address. Furthermore, TCPHound provides connection-to-process mapping, allowing you to identify the application that is generating that traffic.

How does the AS info query work?
---------------------------------
TCP hound uses a self hosted web API to resolve the Autonomous System which supposedly owns the IP range (Hence, you might see TCPHound's own connection in the logs). So as not to accidentally disclose internal IP addresses, you would need to right click on the entry to manually trigger the IP resolution. Furthermore, we do not want to resolve the connection that is used to resolve the connection that is used to resolve the connection... You get the idea.  

Why display both image name and full path?
------------------------------------------
Image name is a quick way to determine the process owning the connection. However, full path is also important, we want to make sure that it is `C:\windows\explorer.exe` and not `C:\Users\user\explorer.exe`.

Can I have the source code?
---------------------------
The utility is closed source at this point in time. If I decide to open source it in future, I will update this page.
